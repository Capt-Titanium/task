list of geekhaven wings i like:-
1. CC
I have keen interest in coding since highschool and personally believe that this might be my area of expertise someday.
2. Design
I find design wing really interesting because it provides you opportunities to show creativeness and innovations.
3. FOSS
As we know, git and github are really important for one to learn if we want to be a part of any wing so, this wing is an important part to focus on.

So far, I liked these wings.
